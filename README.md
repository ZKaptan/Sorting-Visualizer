# Sorting Visualizer Project

This project is a visual learning project use to present different sorting algorithms. I am taking algorithms and data structures at this time, and wanted to a visual tool to see how algorithms worked in real time. The technologies I used in making this project were HTML, CSS, JS, and React! Feel free to try it out using this [link](https://zkaptan.github.io/Sorting-Visualizer/).
